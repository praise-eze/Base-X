# nft-minter

This is a copy of the alchemy nft class and some tweaks mabe by me

run "npm install"
or "yarn install"
To install some of the dependencies 

Then run "npm install @alch/alchemy-web3" to install the alchemy web3 library
Then run "npm start" 
or "yarn start" to start the project at localhost
To later export to an app hosting site
run "npm build" or "yarn build"
to build the project.
